1. `cd` into this directory
1. run `npm install`
1. start your server with `npm run start`
1. open your text editor and start bug hunting!

Your finished application should look like and work like the gif below:

When the user presses `enter` in the new todo bar, it should create a new todo. When they click on a task, it should get crossed out. The CSS is written for you! Just make sure it's being included ðŸ˜‰!
